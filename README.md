## Hi there 👋

The name's Tijmen.

Online I usually go by Trojo, or in case unavailable, Troshujin.

### Currently I'm 🗒️
 - Studying at TU Delft for a master in Computer Science
 - Looking for a part time job (as Software Dev)
 - Just having fun coding my side project (I'm scope creeping)

### My trophies 🏆
 - Built an event driven microservices architecture in Python (shout out to [@IvarStek](https://github.com/IvarStek))
 - I pride myself in my terrible styling and UX but my funtional frontend (claude is my hero)
 - Pretty much finished all of backend in Python (FastAPI though)
